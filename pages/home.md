The **afrimapr** project will create software building blocks in R and learning resources to facilitate the use of spatial data in health and other applications in Africa. The project will promote these resources in Africa and beyond to initiate a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them. 

The R building blocks will make it easier to perform spatial data management tasks that should be straightforward but seldom are, including: summarising data by administrative regions of different levels; joining and displaying data referenced by administrative region names; access to environmental, socio-economic and health data, such as WorldPop, the Malaria Atlas Project and OpenStreetMap; and displaying data in static maps and interactive web applications. Components will be designed for ease of use to target new users of R.

We will run workshops in Liverpool, Ethiopia, Malawi and South Africa trialling and promoting resources. By the end of the project there will be an R package accepted to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and the rOpenSci ecosystem. There will be an open source book describing how components can be used for entry level tasks with step-by-step reproducible instructions. There will be an evolving codebase on Github with a small but active community of users and developers. We will have collected examples of how users in Africa and elsewhere are starting to use the components. We will also have a business plan for how to sustain the project and resources.
